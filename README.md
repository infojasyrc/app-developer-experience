## Understanding the challenges

Because Microservices is on trending, most of the companies believe managing multiple repos, is the best way to go.
However, Monorepos brings another perspective and also some challenges to be consider before using it.

## Conventional commits

In order to handle all projects and packages, the project requires:

- nodejs v22.15.0
- husky
- @commitlint/cli
- @commitlint/config-conventional
- conventional-changelog-cli

### Why use Node tools for Conventional commits?

Because:
• Node ecosystem is well-known for building libraries to implement and enforce connventional commits.
• Commitlint is the most mature and flexible tool for enforcing Conventional Commits.
• Husky is the most popular Git hooks manager — works across any tech stack (Python, JS, Go, etc.).

It’s completely fine and common to install these tools just for Git hook purposes in any project, including Python.

### Requirements

- Install nvm
- Run the following commands

```bash
# install specific version of nodejs
nvm install v22.15.0
# set node version in current shell
nvm use v22.15.0
# installing husky validations
make setup-commit-validation
```

### Additional commands

```bash
# create nodejs rest template
make create-nodejs-rest
# create nodejs gql template
make create-nodejs-gql
# create fastapi-rest-template
make create-py-rest
```
